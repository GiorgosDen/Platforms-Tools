# QuickDBD
QuickDBD is an online platform where you can design a relational DataBase, easily and quickly. When you sign in, you can create a new file for the DB diagram.  On the main screen, you can write the pseudo-code (which is similar to SQL) for the database, and then on the right panel print a diagram visualization. The QuickDBD provides a useful application, that is to diagram export for different server types, like MySQL.
