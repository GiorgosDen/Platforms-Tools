## Smart Irrigation System DB

### Description
This is an example of using the QuickDBD platform to design a Relational DB for a Smart Irrigation System (https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/d/PunqIA). In this case, we have farmers who have some fields. In every field, we have a total of Controllers (Table: FieldController) and each controller has some sensors (Table: Sensor). For every field, we keep a history of irrigation (Table: IrrigationHistory). The farmers can see their field irrigation status from a web app, which explains why DB keeps the username, password, and email for any of them. 

This is a short description of the example. With the first link, you can see the previous example, which is the Database from example 1 of the Node-Red (https://github.com/GiorgosDen/Platforms-Tools/tree/main/Node%20Red/Node%20Red%20Example1), which saves the field data.

Also in this folder, I have added a PDF file (SmartIrrigationDB.pdf), which has the description of DB.
