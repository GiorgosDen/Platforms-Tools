# Electronic Declaration of Responsibility (265882)
This is the procedure followed by the Greek citizen to submit a Responsible Declaration from gov.gr. The electronic declaration that he will issue is legally equivalent to a declaration that bears the original signature and you can either send it electronically or print it and submit it to a public office.
