Based on the official website (https://camunda.com/platform/modeler/) the Camunda Modeler is a low-code visual designer tool to model, connect, and prepare your BPMN business processes for execution. With Camunda Modeler we can align IT and business with a common model and language using standards like BPMN and DMN.
